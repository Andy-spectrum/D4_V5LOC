# Subject-Level Results

### Figure: Design matrix and design orthogonality for a single subject (first-level GLM): sub-009

This figure shows the first-level design matrix used for single-subject analysis in SPM.
The matrix includes task-related regressors (convolved with the canonical HRF), temporal derivatives, nuisance regressors (six head motion parameters), and a constant term.

The lower panel visualizes design orthogonality, quantified as the absolute cosine of the angle between columns of the design matrix.
White values indicate orthogonal regressors, black values indicate collinearity, and intermediate gray values indicate partial correlation.

Overall, the design demonstrates acceptable orthogonality between task regressors and nuisance covariates, supporting stable parameter estimation in the GLM.

 
### Figure: Statistical parametric map (SPM{T}) for the moving dots contrast (single subject)

This figure presents voxel-wise T-statistics for the moving dots condition at the first level.
Statistical maps are displayed on sagittal, coronal, and axial anatomical slices.

The contrast tests task-related activation against baseline using a one-sided T-test.
Results are thresholded at p < 0.05, FWE-corrected at the voxel level, with no extent threshold applied.

Significant activations are observed primarily in posterior visual and motion-sensitive cortical regions, consistent with expected responses to visual motion stimuli.
